## shana2

just an image to html conversion / reformatting thing for my landing pages. it's ugly, yes, I know.

relies on http://www.text-image.com/convert/ to do the legwork in converting the image.

### usage

install iojs or something that has some semblance of ES6 support.

`node shana` when in the repo directory, and pray.  avert eyes when running script, it's using regex to modify/parse html and may summon zalgo.
